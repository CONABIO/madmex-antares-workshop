This is a standalone version of the MAD-MEX system. 

MAD-MEX (Monitoring Activity Data for the Mexican REDD+ program) is a system to provide standardized annual wall-to-wall land cover information by automatic satellite image classification for the Mexican territory in a cost-beneficial manner. One of the aims of the system is to automatically produce a national land cover dataset in a standardized, consistent, transparent and transferable way, to ensure operative activity data monitoring. The integration of data, interfaces, processes, into one uniform, consistent and scalable hardware and software platform are the core components of MAD-MEX, but also, is the result of different governmental mexican organizations that follows international and national standardize guides.

At this moment, MAD-MEX processes data from two satellite: Landsat and Rapideye, and we will provide support for other satellite data in the future.

This repository contains information about the requirements to install and use the MAD-Mex system in a standalone version.

The directory `classifications` contains the classification of landsat and rapideye
